# FileEyes
## What is FileEyes? 
FileEyes is a simple file-reader. It is just like `VSCode`, `Sublimetext3` and other file editors.

The project exists `readme.md` to make you know all about this project; `FileEyes.iml` which is useless; `New txt.txt` for you to test this project; `src\com\java\demo`, there're the code of this project; `.idea`, which is useless, too - it's just a created filter created by `IDEA`.  
## When and Where
You can use it with `JDK18` with your computer everywhere.  
## How to use it? 
Use `VSCode` or `IDEA` to compile and run it.  
## Who made it? 
Lzagddsg made it.  
## Why Lzagddsg made it? 
Because he want's to make it with no reason. :P
